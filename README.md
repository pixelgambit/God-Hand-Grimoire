## About The Game

**God-Hand Grimoire** is a faithful digital adaptation of the classic "Top Trumps" stat-comparison card game, reimagined with a retro JRPG aesthetic for the Game Boy Color. The game features a complete roster of 30 mythological gods from seven different world pantheons.

The core gameplay is simple but addictive: players are dealt a random hand of cards, they choose their strongest stat, and challenge their opponent. The winner claims the loser's card. The ultimate goal is to win every card and complete the Grimoire.

## Key Features

*   **Complete 30-Card Roster:** A full deck of 30 mythological gods from Greek, Norse, Egyptian, Japanese, Hindu, Aztec, and Celtic pantheons.
*   **Balanced JRPG Stats:** Every god has six core stats (ATK, MAG, VIT, DEF, SPD, SPR) that have been carefully balanced to ensure every card is viable and thematically appropriate.
*   **Authentic GBC Aesthetic:** Designed specifically for the Game Boy Color, using a curated, hardware-accurate color palette for all UI elements.
*   **Deep Lore:** Each card is designed with a detailed biography screen in mind, allowing players to dive into the history of each deity.
*   **Dynamic UI:** The game features an interactive, menu-driven interface for selecting stats and navigating the Grimoire.

## Development Process & Documentation

This project was developed following a professional workflow, emphasizing clear documentation and structured data management.

*   **Master Database:** All game data was architected and is maintained in a master Google Spreadsheet. This database is managed by a suite of custom Google Apps Scripts written to automate data formatting, ID generation, and error-prevention.
*   **Game Design Document (GDD):** A comprehensive GDD was created prior to development to outline the project's vision, core mechanics, art style, and technical specifications.
*   **Project Management:** All development tasks were tracked on a Trello board using a Kanban-style workflow to ensure organized, transparent, and incremental progress.
